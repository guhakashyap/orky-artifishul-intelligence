# **RNN WAAAGH - DA MEMORY BOYZ! üß†‚ö°**

Dis is where we build da smartest memory system in da whole galaxy! We're takin' all dat fancy "Recurrent Neural Network" stuff da Humiez use and makin' it propa' Orky.

### **FOR DA BOYZ!**

WAAAGH! Listen up, ya gits!

You ever wanted a Grot dat can remember what happened before and pass it down da line? Or a Squig dat can process sequences one step at a time and remember important stuff? Well, you've come to da right workshop!

Dis 'ere place is for all you Mekboyz who wanna learn how to make fings *remember* in order. We write da kode in a way even a Grot can understand, with lots of comments explainin' all da **Kunnin'** and **Killy bitz**. We got basic RNN boyz, smart LSTM boyz, efficient GRU boyz, and even advanced bidirectional boyz with attention!

So grab yer tools, grab yer thinkin' cap (if it ain't too small), and let's get buildin'! If you've got yer own Orky kode, bring it on! Da more Kunnin' we build, da bigger our WAAAGH! gets!

### **For the Humans**
