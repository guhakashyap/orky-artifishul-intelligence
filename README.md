# **Orky Artifishul Intelligence**

Dis is where we build da smartest gubbinz in da whole galaxy\! We're takin' all dat fancy "Artifishul Intelligence" stuff da Humiez use and makin' it propa' Orky.

### **FOR DA BOYZ\!**

WAAAGH\! Listen up, ya gits\!

You ever wanted a Grot dat knows which Shoota has da most Dakka without even lookin'? Or a Squig dat can sniff out a propa' fight from a mile away? Well, you've come to da right workshop\!

Dis 'ere place is for all you Mekboyz who wanna learn how to make fings *fink*. We write da kode in a way even a Grot can understand, with lots of comments explainin' all da **Kunnin'** and **Killy bitz**. We started with a **Transfo'ma'**, which is like a big mob of Orks all shoutin' at words to figure out what they mean. Now we also got a **Morky Mamba**, which is like a really smart Ork who can remember important stuff and forget da boring stuff! And we got da **Gargant Titans**, which is like a massive Ork war machine with collective WAAAGH memory dat grows stronger over time! Soon, we'll have all sorts of smart gubbinz\!

So grab yer tools, grab yer thinkin' cap (if it ain't too small), and let's get buildin'\! If you've got yer own Orky kode, bring it on\! Da more Kunnin' we build, da bigger our WAAAGH\! gets\!

### **For the Humans**

Welcome\!

This repository is an educational project with a simple goal: to make complex Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts more accessible and entertaining to learn.

The approach is to implement various ML models and algorithms in Python, but with all variables, functions, and comments written from the perspective of a Warhammer 40,000 Ork. By using analogy, humor, and a simplified (if chaotic) narrative, the code aims to provide a more intuitive understanding of how these systems work.

The project currently includes:

* **Orky Transfo'ma' (trans-fo-ma/):** A from-scratch implementation of the Transformer architecture, the foundation for many modern LLMs. The extensive "Orky" comments explain the purpose of everything from embeddings to multi-head attention.

* **Morky Mamba (mam-ba/):** A from-scratch implementation of the Mamba SSM (State Space Model) architecture, featuring selective memory and sequential processing. Unlike Transformers that process all words at once, Mamba processes sequences one word at a time and can selectively remember important information while forgetting unimportant details.

* **Gargant Titans (gargant/):** A from-scratch implementation of the Titans architecture, featuring advanced memory mechanisms and surprise detection. The Gargant is like a massive Ork war machine with collective WAAAGH memory that grows stronger over time, surprise detection that remembers unexpected events, and dynamic memory that learns during battle (test time).

### **Key Differences: Orky Transfo'ma' vs Morky Mamba vs Gargant Titans**

**Orky Transfo'ma':**
- Like a big mob of Orks all shoutin' at words at da same time
- All words can "talk" to each other simultaneously (parallel processing)
- Great for understandin' relationships between words
- Uses attention mechanisms to focus on important words

**Morky Mamba:**
- Like a really smart Ork who reads words one by one and remembers selectively
- Processes words sequentially (one at a time)
- Can selectively remember important stuff and forget boring stuff
- More efficient for long sequences and has better memory management

**Gargant Titans:**
- Like a massive Ork war machine with collective WAAAGH memory
- Features advanced memory mechanisms and surprise detection
- Collective memory that grows stronger over time
- Surprise detection that remembers unexpected events
- Dynamic memory that learns during battle (test time)
- The ultimate Ork war machine with multiple heads and layers

### **Quick Start**

To see da Orks in action, just run:

```bash
# For da Orky Transfo'ma'
cd trans-fo-ma
python trans-fo-ma1.3.py

# For da Morky Mamba  
cd mam-ba
python mam-ba1.0.py

# For da Gargant Titans
cd gargant
python gargant_titans.py
```

All implementations include detailed demonstrations that show how da Orks process information and make predictions!

The plan is to expand this collection to cover other foundational AI/ML topics. Contributions are welcome\! If you have an idea for an "Orky" implementation of an algorithm or model, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
