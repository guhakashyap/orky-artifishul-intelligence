# **Orky Artifishul Intelligence**

Dis is where we build da smartest gubbinz in da whole galaxy\! We're takin' all dat fancy "Artifishul Intelligence" stuff da Humiez use and makin' it propa' Orky.

### **FOR DA BOYZ\!**

WAAAGH\! Listen up, ya gits\!

You ever wanted a Grot dat knows which Shoota has da most Dakka without even lookin'? Or a Squig dat can sniff out a propa' fight from a mile away? Well, you've come to da right workshop\!

Dis 'ere place is for all you Mekboyz who wanna learn how to make fings *fink*. We write da kode in a way even a Grot can understand, with lots of comments explainin' all da **Kunnin'** and **Killy bitz**. We got all sorts of smart arky-tek-churs from basic **RNN Waaagh** memory boyz, to advanced **Krork-HRM** reasoning, to da ultimate **Gargant Titans** war machines! Each arky-tek-chur has its own specialty and WAAAGH energy!

So grab yer tools, grab yer thinkin' cap (if it ain't too small), and let's get buildin'\! If you've got yer own Orky kode, bring it on\! Da more Kunnin' we build, da bigger our WAAAGH\! gets\!

### **For the Humans**

Welcome\!

This repository is an educational project with a simple goal: to make complex Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts more accessible and entertaining to learn.

The approach is to implement various ML models and algorithms in Python, but with all variables, functions, and comments written from the perspective of a Warhammer 40,000 Ork. By using analogy, humor, and a simplified (if chaotic) narrative, the code aims to provide a more intuitive understanding of how these systems work.

The project currently includes:

* **RNN Waaagh (rnn/):** A from-scratch implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks with RNN, LSTM, and GRU variants, featuring sequential memory processing and bidirectional attention. The RNN Waaagh is like having Ork boyz who remember things in order and pass information down the line - each boy remembers what happened before and combines it with new information!

* **Orky Transfo'ma' (trans-fo-ma/):** A from-scratch implementation of the Transformer architecture, the foundation for many modern LLMs. The extensive "Orky" comments explain the purpose of everything from embeddings to multi-head attention.

* **Morky Mamba (mam-ba/):** A from-scratch implementation of the Mamba SSM (State Space Model) architecture, featuring selective memory and sequential processing. Unlike Transformers that process all words at once, Mamba processes sequences one word at a time and can selectively remember important information while forgetting unimportant details.

* **Hydra Waaagh (hydra/):** A from-scratch implementation of the Hydra hybrid architecture, combining State Space Models, multi-head attention, and Mixture of Experts. The Hydra is like having multiple Ork Warbosses all specializing in different things but working together - each head focuses on different aspects (local fights, long-range battles, memory, prediction) while sharing the same WAAAGH energy!

* **Hyena Hierarchy (hyena/):** A from-scratch implementation of the Hyena convolutional sequence model, using global convolutions for efficient long-range dependencies. The Hyena is like the WAAAGH energy field connecting all Orks instantly across the battlefield - processing sequences in linear time with global awareness, perfect for handling massive documents and long conversations!

* **MoE Waaagh (moe/):** A from-scratch implementation of the Mixture of Experts architecture, featuring specialized expert networks with learned routing and sparse activation. The MoE is like having different Ork clans specializing in different jobs - each clan is really good at their specialty, and the smart Warboss (router) assigns tasks to the right clans!

* **Krork-HRM (krork-hrm/):** A from-scratch implementation of the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) architecture, featuring brain-inspired hierarchical processing with high-level Warboss planning and low-level Boyz execution. The Krork-HRM is like the ancient Krork intelligence from before the fall - super-intelligent, hierarchical, and capable of complex reasoning with minimal training data!

* **Gargant Titans (gargant/):** A from-scratch implementation of the Titans architecture, featuring advanced memory mechanisms and surprise detection. The Gargant is like a massive Ork war machine with collective WAAAGH memory that grows stronger over time, surprise detection that remembers unexpected events, and dynamic memory that learns during battle (test time).
