# **Orky Artifishul Intelligence**

Dis is where we build da smartest gubbinz in da whole galaxy\! We're takin' all dat fancy "Artifishul Intelligence" stuff da Humiez use and makin' it propa' Orky.

### **FOR DA BOYZ\!**

WAAAGH\! Listen up, ya gits\!

You ever wanted a Grot dat knows which Shoota has da most Dakka without even lookin'? Or a Squig dat can sniff out a propa' fight from a mile away? Well, you've come to da right workshop\!

Dis 'ere place is for all you Mekboyz who wanna learn how to make fings *fink*. We write da kode in a way even a Grot can understand, with lots of comments explainin' all da **Kunnin'** and **Killy bitz**. We started with a **Transfo'ma'**, which is like a big mob of Orks all shoutin' at words to figure out what they mean. Soon, we'll have all sorts of smart gubbinz\!

So grab yer tools, grab yer thinkin' cap (if it ain't too small), and let's get buildin'\! If you've got yer own Orky kode, bring it on\! Da more Kunnin' we build, da bigger our WAAAGH\! gets\!

### **For the Humans**

Welcome\!

This repository is an educational project with a simple goal: to make complex Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts more accessible and entertaining to learn.

The approach is to implement various ML models and algorithms in Python, but with all variables, functions, and comments written from the perspective of a Warhammer 40,000 Ork. By using analogy, humor, and a simplified (if chaotic) narrative, the code aims to provide a more intuitive understanding of how these systems work.

The project currently includes:

* **Orky Transfo'ma' (trans-fo-ma.py):** A from-scratch implementation of the Transformer architecture, the foundation for many modern LLMs. The extensive "Orky" comments explain the purpose of everything from embeddings to multi-head attention.

The plan is to expand this collection to cover other foundational AI/ML topics. Contributions are welcome\! If you have an idea for an "Orky" implementation of an algorithm or model, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
