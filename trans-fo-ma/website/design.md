# ORKY TRANSFO'MA' WEBSITE DESIGN

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

**Grimdark Tech-Aesthetic**: Channel the brutal, ramshackle world of WH40k Orks where technology shouldn't work but does through sheer belief. The design embodies the contradiction of crude, scrap-built machinery that somehow functions through the power of the WAAAGH!

**Color Psychology Based on Ork Beliefs**:
- **RED**: Speed and aggression - used for interactive elements and animations
- **YELLOW**: Wealth and bigger explosions - used for highlights and important information  
- **BLUE**: Luck and cunning - used for data visualization and technical elements
- **GREEN**: Ork skin and superiority - used as primary background color
- **BLACK/WHITE**: Death and toughness - used for text and structural elements
- **PURPLE**: Stealth - used sparingly for hidden features

## VISUAL LANGUAGE

**Typography**: 
- Display: "Orkney" - A brutal, industrial typeface with sharp edges
- Body: "Roboto Mono" - Technical monospace for code and data
- Headers: Massive, aggressive lettering that dominates the space

**Layout Principles**:
- Asymmetrical, ramshackle compositions that feel cobbled together
- Heavy use of industrial textures and metal surfaces
- Glyphs and symbols integrated throughout the design
- Chaotic but functional - like Ork technology itself

## COLOR PALETTE

**Primary Colors**:
- Ork Green: #2D5016 (deep, muddy green)
- Mekboy Blue: #1E3A8A (technical blue for data)
- Red Wunz: #DC2626 (aggressive red for interactions)
- Yellow Teef: #EAB308 (wealth yellow for highlights)

**Secondary Colors**:
- Rust Orange: #EA580C (weathered metal)
- Scrap Metal: #6B7280 (neutral gray)
- Warp Purple: #7C3AED (mystical purple)
- Bone White: #F3F4F6 (off-white for contrast)

**Background**: 
- Deep void black (#0F172A) with subtle texture
- Industrial metal grid patterns
- Scattered Ork glyphs and symbols

## EFFECTS & ANIMATIONS

**Core Libraries Used**:
- **Anime.js**: Smooth, aggressive animations for Ork components
- **ECharts.js**: Attention heatmaps and data visualization
- **P5.js**: Creative coding for particle effects and Ork glyphs
- **Matter.js**: Physics-based interactions for scrap metal
- **Shader-park**: Industrial metal and rust textures
- **PIXI.js**: High-performance visual effects

**Animation Style**:
- Jerky, aggressive movements that feel Orky
- Sudden appearances and disappearances
- Metal grinding and spark effects
- Attention patterns that pulse like a beating heart

**Visual Effects**:
- Rust and weathering on all metal surfaces
- Sparks and electrical arcs for interactions
- Smoke and particle effects for atmosphere
- Glitch effects for malfunctioning technology

## INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS

**Component Styling**:
- Scrap metal borders with rust textures
- Glowing red eyes for active states
- Mechanical sound effects for interactions
- Attention weights visualized as energy flows

**Hover Effects**:
- Elements glow with WAAAGH energy
- Metal surfaces show wear and scratches
- Glyphs pulse with psychic power
- Components rattle and shake like unstable machinery

**Data Visualization**:
- Attention patterns as glowing energy conduits
- Multi-head attention shown as branching lightning
- Transformer layers as stacked mechanical components
- Word embeddings as floating Ork glyphs

## ATMOSPHERE

**Audio Design**:
- Mechanical grinding sounds
- Electrical hums and sparks
- Distant WAAAGH chanting
- Metal clanking and bashing

**Environmental Effects**:
- Subtle smoke wisps across the screen
- Flickering industrial lighting
- Floating scrap metal particles
- Occasional glitch effects suggesting unstable technology

The overall effect should make users feel like they're interacting with actual Ork technology - crude, brutal, but somehow functional through the power of belief!
