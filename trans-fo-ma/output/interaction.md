# ORKY TRANSFO'MA' WEBSITE INTERACTION DESIGN

## MAIN INTERACTIVE COMPONENTS

### 1. ORKY TRANSFORMER VISUALIZER
**Interactive Transformer Architecture Diagram**
- Users can click on different components (OrkAttentionHead, MultiHeadOrkAttention, OrkFeedForward, etc.)
- Each component shows animated explanation of how it works
- Real-time attention weight visualization when users input their own Orky sentences
- Component highlights and shows data flow with animated arrows

### 2. ORK VOCABULARY BUILDER
**Interactive Vocabulary Management**
- Users can add their own Orky words to the vocabulary
- Drag-and-drop interface to build custom Ork sentences
- Real-time tokenization and embedding visualization
- Word similarity calculator showing how Orky words relate to each other

### 3. ATTENTION MECHANISM DEMONSTRATOR
**Live Attention Pattern Visualization**
- Interactive heatmap showing which words pay attention to which other words
- Users can click on any word to see its attention patterns
- Multi-head attention visualization with different colors for each Ork head
- Slider to control which layer and head to visualize

### 4. ORKY SENTENCE GENERATOR
**Text Generation Interface**
- Users input starting words and watch the transformer generate Orky text
- Step-by-step generation showing how each word is chosen
- Temperature and sampling controls to adjust generation randomness
- Save and share generated Orky wisdom

## USER INTERACTION FLOW

1. **Landing**: Hero section with animated Orky transformer diagram
2. **Explore**: Click components to learn how they work
3. **Experiment**: Input custom sentences and see attention patterns
4. **Create**: Build vocabulary and generate new Orky text
5. **Learn**: Access detailed documentation with code examples

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

- Use PyTorch.js or similar to run actual transformer computations in browser
- ECharts.js for interactive attention heatmaps
- Anime.js for smooth component animations
- Matter.js for physics-based word interactions
- P5.js for creative coding visualizations
- Shader effects for Orky atmosphere
