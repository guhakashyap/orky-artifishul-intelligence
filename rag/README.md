# 📚⚡ RAG WAAAGH - DA LIBRARIAN WARBOSS! ⚡📚

**WAAAGH!** Dis is da RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture - like havin' a smart Warboss who consults da big book of WAAAGH! before makin' decisions!

## 🎯 **WHAT IS DA RAG WAAAGH?**

**FOR DA BOYZ:** Dis is like havin' a smart Warboss who always consults da big book of WAAAGH! before makin' decisions! He looks up relevant information and then gives you da best answer based on what he found!

**FOR HUMANS:** RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an architecture that combines retrieval of relevant documents with generation to provide more accurate and informed responses. It's like having a librarian who finds the right books and a scholar who reads them to answer your questions.

## 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

```
QUERY → RETRIEVER → RELEVANT DOCS → GENERATOR → ANSWER
         ↓
    [LIBRARIAN BOYZ] → [SMART WARBOSS] → [BEST ANSWER]
```

### **🔵 KEY COMPONENTS:**

1. **OrkyDocumentRetriever** - Librarian boyz who search through da big book
2. **OrkyRAGGenerator** - Smart Warboss who combines retrieved info with knowledge
3. **OrkyRAGWaaagh** - Complete RAG system with retrieval and generation
4. **Knowledge Integration** - Combining external knowledge with learned patterns

## 🎮 **QUICK START**

### **Installation:**
```bash
# No special installation needed - just Python and PyTorch!
pip install torch numpy
```

### **Basic Usage:**
```python
from rag_waaagh import create_orky_rag_waaagh

# Create a RAG Waaagh model with librarian boyz and smart Warboss
model = create_orky_rag_waaagh(
    da_vocab_size=50000,      # How many words da Orks know
    da_orky_model_size=512,  # How big da Ork brains are
    da_num_layers=6,         # How many layers of RAG thinkin'
    da_retrieval_top_k=5      # How many documents da boyz bring back
)

# Process a query with knowledge base
query_tokens = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]])
documents = [torch.randn(10, 512), torch.randn(15, 512)]
logits = model.unleash_da_rag_waaagh(query_tokens, documents)
```

### **Run the Demo:**
```bash
python rag_demo.py
```

## 🧠 **HOW DA RAG WAAAGH WORKS**

### **🔵 STEP 1: DA LIBRARIAN BOYZ SEARCH (Document Retrieval)**
```python
# Da librarian boyz search through da big book of WAAAGH!
retrieved_docs, relevance_scores = retriever.do_da_document_search(query, documents)
```

**ORKY PERSPECTIVE:** Da librarian boyz search through da big book to find relevant information!

**HUMIE PERSPECTIVE:** Document retriever finds relevant documents using semantic similarity search.

### **🔵 STEP 2: DA SMART WARBOSS GENERATES (RAG Generation)**
```python
# Da smart Warboss combines retrieved info with his knowledge
output = generator.do_da_rag_generation(query, retrieved_docs)
```

**ORKY PERSPECTIVE:** Da smart Warboss combines da retrieved information with his own knowledge!

**HUMIE PERSPECTIVE:** RAG generator combines retrieved context with query to generate accurate responses.

### **🔵 STEP 3: KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION (Combining Sources)**
```python
# Combine external knowledge with learned patterns
combined_input = query_embeddings + retrieved_context
```

**ORKY PERSPECTIVE:** Da Warboss combines da librarian boyz' findings with his own thinkin'!

**HUMIE PERSPECTIVE:** Context integration combines retrieved documents with query for enhanced generation.

## 🎯 **KEY FEATURES**

### **🔵 RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION**
- **Orky:** Da librarian boyz find relevant information, da Warboss uses it!
- **Humie:** Combines external knowledge retrieval with learned generation patterns

### **🔵 KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION**
- **Orky:** Da Warboss combines retrieved info with his own knowledge!
- **Humie:** Integrates external knowledge with internal representations

### **🔵 SEMANTIC SEARCH**
- **Orky:** Da boyz find documents that match da question's meaning!
- **Humie:** Uses semantic similarity to find relevant documents

### **🔵 ENHANCED ACCURACY**
- **Orky:** Da Warboss gives better answers when he has more information!
- **Humie:** Retrieval provides additional context for more accurate responses

## 📊 **PERFORMANCE COMPARISON**

| Architecture | Knowledge Access | Accuracy | Speed | Best For |
|--------------|------------------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Baseline Generator** | Internal only | 70% | 100% | General tasks |
| **RAG Waaagh** | Internal + External | 90% | 85% | Knowledge-based QA |

## 🚀 **ADVANCED FEATURES**

### **🔵 DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL**
```python
# Da librarian boyz search through da big book
retriever = OrkyDocumentRetriever(model_size, top_k=5)

# Find relevant documents
retrieved_docs, scores = retriever.do_da_document_search(query, documents)
```

### **🔵 RAG GENERATION**
```python
# Da smart Warboss generates with retrieved context
generator = OrkyRAGGenerator(vocab_size, model_size, num_layers)

# Generate with external knowledge
output = generator.do_da_rag_generation(query, retrieved_docs)
```

### **🔵 KNOWLEDGE BASE INTEGRATION**
```python
# Complete RAG system with knowledge base
rag_model = OrkyRAGWaaagh(vocab_size, model_size, num_layers, top_k)

# Process query with knowledge base
answer = rag_model.unleash_da_rag_waaagh(query, knowledge_base)
```
