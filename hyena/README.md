# HYENA HIERARCHY! - DA CONVOLUTIONAL SEQUENCE WAR MACHINE! 🐍⚡

**WAAAGH!** Welcome to da Hyena - da fastest Ork war machine for processin' long sequences! Dis ain't slow quadratic attention - we use global convolutions dat connect da whole horde instantly like da WAAAGH energy field!

## 🐍 WHAT IS DA HYENA?

Da Hyena is a **convolutional sequence model** dat achieves efficient long-range dependencies through global convolutions, processin' sequences faster dan traditional attention while maintainin' all da important information:

- **🌊 Global Convolutions**: Like da WAAAGH energy connectin' all Orks instantly across da battlefield
- **🏗️ Hierarchical Processing**: Multiple layers process information at different scales (like Ork command hierarchy)
- **⚡ Linear Complexity**: Processes sequences in O(n) time instead of O(n²) like attention
- **🎯 Implicit Position Awareness**: Da convolution patterns automatically know where each token is
- **🔄 Efficient Generation**: Fast inference for text generation and other sequence tasks

### **For da Humans**

The Hyena architecture represents a breakthrough in efficient sequence modeling that challenges the dominance of attention-based Transformers:

1. **Speed**: Global convolutions provide linear-time processing for any sequence length
2. **Memory Efficiency**: No need to store massive attention matrices
3. **Scalability**: Naturally handles very long sequences (100k+ tokens)
4. **Simplicity**: Convolution-based approach is easier to optimize and parallelize
5. **Performance**: Competitive results with Transformers while being much faster

## 🟡 **How da Hyena Hierarchy Works (Step-by-Step for Gits!)**

**Right, you're back for more brain-food!** Good on ya! Last time we talked about da Hydra with its two 'eads. Now we're gonna talk about da **Hyena-Hierarchy**.

This one's different. It's not about one big thought or a sneaky runna grot. This one is about organizashun. It works like a whole Waaagh!—from da lowly Boyz up to da Warboss 'imself. It's all about lookin' at da problem at different sizes.

Let's say da message is: **"DA BIG MEK FIXED DA RED TRUKK WITH A ZOGGIN' BIG WRENCH."**

Here's how da Hyena-Hierarchy gets its kunnin'.

### **Step 1: Line Up Da Boyz (Input)**

You know this bit. Words get turned into numbers. `DA`, `BIG`, `MEK`, `FIXED`, `DA`, and so on. It's like gettin' all da Boyz in your Waaagh! lined up in a big row before the scrap.

### **Step 2: Da First Wave - Da Boyz' View (Short Filters)**

Now, we send in da Boyz! But these ain't normal Boyz. They're special Boyz with "Sniffa Goggles" (the humies call 'em **filters** or **convolutions**). Each squad of Boyz only looks for one little thing. They can only see two or three words at a time right in front of 'em.

* One squad runs along the line lookin' for **"Kinda-Word + Thingy-Word."** They get all excited when they see `BIG MEK`, `RED TRUKK`, and `BIG WRENCH`. They make a note: "Found some describey-word thingies!"
* Another squad runs along lookin' for **"Who + Did-Wot."** They spot `MEK FIXED` and make a note: "Found a doin'-somethin' bit!"

These Boyz are fast but dumb. They only see the small stuff right in front of their noses. They don't know the whole plan.

### **Step 3: Da Second Wave - Da Nobs' View (Medium Filters)**

Now da Nobs step in. They don't look at the words. They look at the *notes* left by the squads of Boyz! Da Nobs have bigger Sniffa Goggles, so they can see bigger patterns.

* A Nob looks at the Boyz' notes and sees: "Found a `describey-word thingy` (`BIG MEK`) right next to a `doin'-somethin' bit` (`FIXED`) which is next to another `describey-word thingy` (`RED TRUKK`)."
* The Nob is smarter than a Boy. He puts it together and makes a new note: **"A big mek did somethin' to a red trukk!"**

See? The Nobs take the little bits of info from the Boyz and build a bigger picture. They understand phrases and simple ideas.

### **Step 4: Da Warboss' View - Da Whole Plan! (Long Filters)**

Finally, da Warboss looks at the notes from all his Nobs. He doesn't care about da individual Boyz or words anymore. He just looks at the big ideas his Nobs found.

* He sees one Nob's note: "A big mek did somethin' to a red trukk!"
* He sees another Nob's note: "The thing he did involved a big wrench!"

The Warboss, being the most kunnin' of all, puts these final notes together and understands the *entire sentence* in one go. He sees the whole plan: a specific person (Big Mek) performed an action (fixed) on an object (Red Trukk) using a tool (Big Wrench).

This final, super-kunnin' thought is a set of numbers that gets passed to the last bit of the machine to guess the next word. Because the Warboss has the full picture, he can make a really good guess, like maybe the next word is "SO" or "NOW."

So, da Hyena-Hierarchy is like a proper command structure. **The Boyz find the details, the Nobs find the tactics, and the Warboss figures out the strategy.** It's a very organized way to get a lot of kunnin' very fast! WAAAGH!

---

**WAAAGH!** Da Hyena is ready to conquer any sequence processing task! Whether you're processin' massive documents, generatin' endless stories, or analyzin' huge datasets - da Hyena's global convolutions and hierarchical processing will get da job done faster and better dan ever before!
