## üî¥ **How da Morky Mamba Works (Step-by-Step for Gits!)**

**ALRIGHT, YA GIT, SIT DOWN!** So ya figured out da Transfo'ma', but now ya wanna know about da **Morky Mamba**? Dat's a different kinda beast. It's less like a big stompy Gargant and more like a sneaky, kunnin' Squig that remembers everythin'.

Da Transfo'ma' does a "Big Look-See" at all yer words at once. Da Mamba is faster, it works more like a Grot runnin' a message down a long line of Boyz.

Let's say da order from da Warboss is: **"FIRST WE KRUMP, DEN WE LOOT!"**

Here's how da Morky Mamba figures it out, step-by-step.

### **Step 1: Givin' da Grot da Message (Input)**

Just like before, we gotta turn da words into numbers a machine can understand.

* "FIRST", "WE", "KRUMP", "DEN", "WE", "LOOT" get turned into numbers (tokens).
* Each number gets a list of stats (embedding) to give it some meanin'.

This is like writin' down the message on a slate and handin' it to a special Runna Grot. This Grot is gonna run past a line of Boyz, and each Boy is one of yer words in order.

### **Step 2: Da Grot's Run (The Selective Scan)**

This is da main bit of da Mamba. The Runna Grot has a tiny brain, so he can only hold one thought at a time. We'll call this thought his **"memory"** (the humies call it a "state"). As he runs past each Ork in the line, his memory gets updated.

#### **The First Boy: "FIRST"**

The Grot runs up to the first Ork, who represents the word **"FIRST"**. This Ork looks at the Grot's empty memory and yells two things at him:
1.  **"FORGET STUFF!"**: "Yer memory is empty, ya git, so there's nothin' to forget!"
2.  **"REMEMBER DIS!"**: "The most important thing right now is that this is the *first* part of the plan! Shove that in yer brain!"

The Grot updates his memory. It now just holds the idea of "this is the beginning."

#### **The Second Boy: "WE"**

The Grot runs to the next Ork, representing **"WE"**. This Ork sees the Grot's memory and yells:
1.  **"FORGET STUFF!"**: "That 'first' bit ain't so important anymore. Keep a little of it, but mostly forget it."
2.  **"REMEMBER DIS!"**: "The important bit now is 'WE'. This plan is about *us*! Add that to yer memory!"

The Grot's memory now holds a mix of "this is the beginning" and "it's about us."

#### **The Third Boy: "KRUMP"**

Now for the good part. The Grot gets to the **"KRUMP"** Ork. This Ork is very loud.
1.  **"FORGET STUFF!"**: "Who cares about 'we' or 'first'?! Forget most of that zoggin' stuff!"
2.  **"REMEMBER DIS!"**: "**KRUMPIN'!** That's the most important bit! Burn it into yer tiny brain! **KRUMP!**"

The Grot's memory is now almost completely full of the glorious idea of "KRUMP". This is the "selective" part of the scan. The model *selects* what to keep and what to forget based on how important the new word is. A word like "KRUMP" is very important, so it overrides a lot of the old memory. A word like "da" is less important, so it wouldn't change the memory much.

This continues all the way down the line for **"DEN"**, **"WE"**, and **"LOOT"**. By the time the Grot reaches the end of the line, his little memory contains the kunnin' of the *whole sentence*, squished down into one smarty-pants thought.

### **Step 3: Wot da Grot Learned (The Output)**

After the Grot has finished his run, we grab him and look at his final memory. This memory is a list of numbers that represents the meaning of "FIRST WE KRUMP, DEN WE LOOT!"

This final list of numbers is then used to guess what comes next, just like in da Transfo'ma'. It goes through a final bit that turns the numbers into a guess for the next word.

So if you just gave it "FIRST WE KRUMP," the Grot's memory would be full of "KRUMPIN'," and it would probably guess the next word is "DA" or "GITZ".

That's da Morky Mamba. It's a fast, sneaky way of readin' a sentence one bit at a time, constantly decidin' wot's important to remember and wot's useless gubbinz to forget. It's proppa kunnin', not just brutal!

## WAAAGH! (That means "Let's do this with SELECTIVE MEMORY!" in Ork)
