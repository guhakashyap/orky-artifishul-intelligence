## DA MORKY MAMBA'S KEY FEATURES

### ðŸ§  **Selective Memory System**
- **MorkySelectiveSSM**: Ork's selective memory system
- **Remember Important**: Orks remember important information
- **Forget Boring**: Orks forget unimportant details
- **Sequential Processing**: Orks process words one by one

### âš¡ **State Space Model Architecture**
- **Hidden State**: Ork's internal memory state
- **State Transition**: How memories change over time
- **Selective Mechanism**: Choose what to remember and what to forget
- **Efficient Processing**: Better for long sequences than transformers

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Differences from Transformers**

| **Morky Mamba** | **Orky Transfo'ma'** |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Sequential processing | Parallel processing |
| Selective memory | Attention-based |
| State space model | Transformer architecture |
| Efficient for long sequences | Great for relationships |
