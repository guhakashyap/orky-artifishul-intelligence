KRORK-HRM - DA ULTIMATE HIERARCHICAL REASONING MACHINE! ðŸ§ âš¡

Dis is da most advanced Ork reasoning machine ever built! Like da ancient Krorks
from before da fall - super-intelligent, hierarchical, and capable of complex
reasoning with minimal training data!

WHAT IS DA KRORK-HRM?
- Hierarchical reasoning like da ancient Krorks
- High-level Warboss planning + Low-level Boyz execution
- 100x faster reasoning than regular LLMs
- Only needs 1000 training examples (not millions!)
- 27 million parameters (not billions!)
- Single forward pass for complex reasoning

FOR DA BOYZ: Dis is like havin' da ancient Krork intelligence - hierarchical
thinkin' where da Warboss plans da big strategy while da boyz handle da details!
FOR HUMANS: This implements the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) architecture
with brain-inspired hierarchical processing for efficient reasoning.
