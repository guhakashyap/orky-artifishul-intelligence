# üß†‚ö° KRORK-HRM - DA ULTIMATE HIERARCHICAL REASONING MACHINE! ‚ö°üß†

**WAAAGH!** Dis is da most advanced Ork reasoning machine ever built! Like da ancient Krorks from before da fall - super-intelligent, hierarchical, and capable of complex reasoning with minimal training data!

## üéØ **WHAT IS DA KRORK-HRM?**

**FOR DA BOYZ:** Dis is like havin' da ancient Krork intelligence - hierarchical thinkin' where da Warboss plans da big strategy while da boyz handle da details! It's like havin' both da big picture AND da details workin' together in perfect harmony!

**FOR HUMANS:** Krork-HRM is a novel recurrent architecture inspired by hierarchical processing in the human brain, featuring two interdependent recurrent modules:
- **High-level module:** Slow, abstract planning (Warboss)
- **Low-level module:** Rapid, detailed computations (Boyz)

### **üîµ KEY COMPONENTS:**

1. **OrkyHighLevelWarboss** - Strategic planner for high-level thinking
2. **OrkyLowLevelBoyz** - Tactical executors for detailed work
3. **OrkyKrorkHRM** - Complete hierarchical reasoning system
4. **Hierarchical Coordination** - Warboss + Boyz working together

## üéÆ **QUICK START**

### **Installation:**
```bash
# No special installation needed - just Python and PyTorch!
pip install torch numpy
```

### **Basic Usage:**
```python
from krork_hrm import create_orky_krork_hrm

# Create a Krork-HRM model with hierarchical reasoning
model = create_orky_krork_hrm(
    da_vocab_size=50000,      # How many words da Orks know
    da_orky_model_size=512,   # How big da Ork brains are
    da_warboss_hidden_size=1024, # How much brain power da Warboss gets
    da_boyz_hidden_size=512,  # How much brain power each boy gets
    da_num_layers=6,          # How many layers of hierarchical coordination
    da_max_seq_len=2048       # How long da battle can be
)

# Process some tokens through da Krork-HRM system
input_tokens = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]])
logits = model.unleash_da_krork_reasoning(input_tokens)
```

### **Run the Demo:**
```bash
python krork_demo.py
```

## üß† **HOW DA KRORK-HRM WORKS**

### **üîµ STEP 1: WARBOSS STRATEGIC PLANNIN' (High-Level Thinking)**
```python
# Da Warboss analyzes da situation and plans da big strategy
strategic_guidance, warboss_state = warboss.do_da_strategic_plannin(
    general_thoughts, previous_warboss_state
)
```

**ORKY PERSPECTIVE:** Da smart Warboss analyzes da situation and plans da overall WAAAGH strategy!

**HUMIE PERSPECTIVE:** High-level module handles slow, abstract planning and strategic thinking.

### **üîµ STEP 2: BOYZ TACTICAL EXECUTION (Low-Level Execution)**
```python
# Da boyz execute da tactical actions based on Warboss guidance
tactical_results, boyz_state = boyz.do_da_tactical_execution(
    general_thoughts, strategic_guidance, previous_boyz_state
)
```

**ORKY PERSPECTIVE:** Da boyz execute da tactical actions while followin' da Warboss's strategic guidance!

**HUMIE PERSPECTIVE:** Low-level module handles rapid, detailed computations and tactical execution.

### **üîµ STEP 3: HIERARCHICAL COORDINATION (Warboss + Boyz)**
```python
# Combine da strategic guidance with tactical execution
combined_results = general_thoughts + strategic_guidance + tactical_results
```

**ORKY PERSPECTIVE:** Da Warboss and da boyz work together in perfect harmony!

**HUMIE PERSPECTIVE:** Hierarchical coordination combines high-level planning with low-level execution.

```

### **üîµ MULTI-LAYER HIERARCHY**
```python

for krork_layer in krork_layers:
    strategic_guidance = krork_layer['warboss'].do_da_strategic_plannin(thoughts)
    tactical_results = krork_layer['boyz'].do_da_tactical_execution(thoughts, strategic_guidance)
    thoughts = thoughts + strategic_guidance + tactical_results
```

### **üîµ EFFICIENT SCALING**
```python
# More layers = deeper hierarchical reasoning

## üß† **How da Krork-HRM Works (Step-by-Step for Gits!)**

**OI! Look at you!** "Gettin' smart," is it? You're startin' to sound less like a Git and more like a proper Brainboy! Good! Dat means yer ready for da final lesson. Yer ready for da biggest, most kunnin' of 'em all... da **Krork-HRM!**

The Krork, see, were da Orks from long ago. They weren't just brutal‚Äîthey were brilliant. They didn't just fight; they made *plans*. And that's what this machine does. It doesn't just read words; it tries to understand the whole scrap, like a Warboss with a big battle map.

Let's say da report from da front is: **"NOB GITSPLITTA KRUMPED DA GROT 'CUZ DA GROT DROPPED 'IS FAVORITE SHOOTA."**

A normal finkin' machine understands the words. The Krork-HRM understands the *story*.

### **Step 1: A Scout Reports In (Input)**

Same as always. Da sentence gets turned into numbers. This is like a scout Grot runnin' up to the command tent, out of breath and yellin' what he saw.

### **Step 2: Da Nob Listens to da Yellin' (Text Understanding)**

First, the message goes to a normal part of the machine, like a Transfo'ma' 'ead. This is like the Nob on duty. He listens to the Grot's report and gets the basic idea. He understands the words and who did what. He knows "Gitsplitta" did some "krumpin'" on a "grot" with a "shoota" involved somehow. It's a good summary, but it's just the surface.

### **Step 3: Da Warboss Draws da Battle Map (The Reasoning Bit)**

This is the special Krork part. The Nob's summary goes up to the Warboss. The Warboss don't just listen. He gets out his big map and his little models and he builds a picture of what *really* happened. This ain't a word-map, it's an idea-map.

1.  **He puts down the pieces:**
    * A big piece for `NOB GITSPLITTA`.
    * A small piece for `DA GROT`.
    * A shiny piece for `FAVORITE SHOOTA`.

2.  **He shows what happened (The Actions):**
    * He draws a big, red arrow from `(GITSPLITTA)` to `(DA GROT)` and labels it **KRUMPED**.
    * He draws another arrow from `(DA GROT)` to `(FAVORITE SHOOTA)` and labels it **DROPPED**.

3.  **NOW, DA KUNNIN' PART! He finds the "Why" (The Relationship):**
    * He looks at the word **"'CUZ"**. That's a reason-word!
    * He draws a big, glowing line connecting the **DROPPED** action to the **KRUMPED** action. This line means: "THIS happened *BECAUSE* OF THAT."

The Warboss now has a perfect picture in his head. Not just a string of words, but a map of who did what to whom, and *why*. He understands the situation.

### **Step 4: Uzin' da Map to Lead da WAAAGH! (Output)**

Now, when you ask the Krork-HRM a question, it doesn't just guess from the words. It looks at its shiny new battle map.

* If you ask: **"Wot did Gitsplitta do?"**
    It looks at the map, sees the `(GITSPLITTA)` piece, and follows the **KRUMPED** arrow to the `(DA GROT)` piece. It answers: "He krumped da grot."

* But here's the smart bit. If you ask: **"Why did da grot get krumped?"**
    A lesser machine might get confused. But the Krork-HRM looks at the **KRUMPED** action on its map, sees the glowing **"BECAUSE"** line, and follows it back to the **DROPPED** action. It answers: **"'Cuz he dropped da Nob's favorite shoota!"**

See? You're smart enough to get it now! Da other models are Boyz who can follow orders. Da Krork-HRM is a Warboss who can write the whole battle plan 'cuz he understands *why* the fighting is happening. It builds a map of ideas, not just words.

That's real kunnin'. That's the Krork way. Now you've seen 'em all. You're ready for your own WAAAGH!, ya smart git! Go on, get to it!

## üéâ **CONCLUSION**

**WAAAGH!** Da Krork-HRM architecture shows how hierarchical reasoning can solve complex problems with minimal training data! Da Warboss handles strategic plannin' while da boyz handle tactical execution, makin' da whole system incredibly efficient!

**Dis is da ultimate guide to Orky Hierarchical Reasoning!** üß†‚ö°üß†
