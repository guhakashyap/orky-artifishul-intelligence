```python
from gargant_titans import GargantTitans

# Create da Gargant
da_gargant = GargantTitans(
    da_orky_vocab_size=21,
    da_orky_model_size=128,
    num_orky_heads=8,

)

# Run da Gargant
da_output, da_attention, da_surprise, da_memory = da_gargant.do_da_gargant_titans_processin(da_input)
```

### Running the Demo
```bash
cd transformers/gargant/
python3 gargant_titans.py      # Basic Gargant demonstration
python3 gargant_demo.py        # Comprehensive demonstration
```

## DA GARGANT'S MEMORY ARCHITECTURE

### Memory Components
1. **WaaaghMemoryBank**: Central memory storage
2. **OrkSurpriseDetector**: Surprise detection and memory enhancement
3. **Memory Integration**: All attention heads access collective memory
4. **Dynamic Updates**: Memory updates during inference

### Memory Flow
1. **Input Processing**: Words are processed with memory access
2. **Surprise Detection**: Unexpected events are detected
3. **Memory Retrieval**: Relevant memories are accessed
4. **Memory Update**: New information is stored based on surprise
5. **Output Generation**: Enhanced output with memory integration

## TITANS ARCHITECTURE INSPIRATION

The Gargant is inspired by the Titans architecture with Orky theming:

- **Surprise Mechanisms**: Based on human brain's tendency to remember unexpected events
- **Dynamic Memory**: Learning and memorization during test time
- **Memory Integration**: Different types of memory working together
- **Orky Enhancement**: Warhammer 40K theming with Ork personality

## üü£ **How da Gargant Titans Works (Step-by-Step for Gits!)**

**Right then, ya git!** You're climbin' da ladduh of kunnin'! We've seen models with one 'ead, two 'eads, and even a whole command structure. Now, get ready for da biggest of 'em all: da **Gargant-Titans!**

Think of this model like a real Gargant. A massive, stompy war machine with different decks and different crews doin' different jobs. It's built to handle a *really* long message, like a whole Waaagh! plan from start to finish, without gettin' confused.

Let's say da plan is a long one: **"ALL DA BOYZ IN DA EVIL SUNZ GO TO DA LEFT. ALL DA BOYZ IN DA GOFF KLAN GO TO DA RIGHT. WHEN DA BIG BOMB GOES BOOM, EVERYONE CHARGES AT DA HUMIES IN DA MIDDLE!"**

Here's how da Gargant figures this out.

### **Step 1: Loadin' da Scrap Metal (Input)**

Same as always. Da whole long message gets turned into a big long line of numbers. This is like dumpin' a giant mountain of scrap metal in front of your Gargant, ready to be turned into somethin' killy.

### **Step 2: Da Grot Dekk - Sortin' da Bitz (Local Processing)**

A Gargant is big, but it can't melt down a whole mountain at once. That's a job for the Gretchin!

* **Grabbin' Chunks:** First, a giant claw splits the long message into smaller, manageable chunks.
    * Chunk 1: "ALL DA BOYZ IN DA EVIL SUNZ GO TO DA LEFT."
    * Chunk 2: "ALL DA BOYZ IN DA GOFF KLAN GO TO DA RIGHT."
    * Chunk 3: "WHEN DA BIG BOMB GOES BOOM, EVERYONE CHARGES AT DA HUMIES IN DA MIDDLE!"

* **Grot Krews:** Each chunk is dropped down to the Grot Dekk. Down here, you got dozens of Grot krews. Each krew gets one chunk and has to figure out what's important in *their* little bit. They do a "fast look-see" (a simple, local attention) on their own chunk.

* **Makin' "Ingots of Kunnin'":** After a Grot krew figures out the main idea of their chunk, they smelt it down into one solid, shiny brick of information. I call this an **"Ingot of Kunnin'."**
    * Chunk 1 becomes Ingot 1: **(Evil Sunz go left)**
    * Chunk 2 becomes Ingot 2: **(Goffs go right)**
    * Chunk 3 becomes Ingot 3: **(Charge middle on boom)**

The Grots don't know the whole plan. They just do their one job: turn a messy chunk of words into one clean ingot of meaning.

### **Step 3: Da Nob Dekk - Forgin' da Big Plan (Global Processing)**

Now, all those shiny Ingots of Kunnin' are sent up a conveyor belt to the Nob Dekk. The Nobs are smarter than Grots. They don't look at the little words anymore; they only look at the big, important ingots.

* **Da Big Look-See (On Ingots):** Up here, the Nobs do a proper "Big Look-See" (full-on attention) but *only* on the handful of ingots. They look at Ingot 1, Ingot 2, and Ingot 3 and ask, "How do these ideas fit together?"
    * They see **(Evil Sunz go left)**.
    * They see **(Goffs go right)**.
    * They see **(Charge middle on boom)**.

Because they're lookin' at a few smart ingots instead of a thousand dumb words, they can figure out the master plan much faster. They see it's a pincer movement, a classic Orky taktik!

### **Step 4: FIRE DA BIG GUN! (Output)**

The final, brilliant plan forged by the Nobs is loaded into the Gargant's main cannon. This super-concentrated blast of kunnin' is used to predict what comes next. Because it understands the whole long plan, from the Grot's little details to the Nob's big picture, its guess is gonna be dead-on.

So da Gargant-Titans model is for when ya got a LOT to fink about. **It breaks a big, scary problem into small, easy ones for the Grots, then has the Nobs put the smart solutions together to make a master plan.** It's how ya win the whole war, not just one little scrap! WAAAGH!

## WAAAGH! (That means "Let's do this with TITAN POWER!" in Ork)
